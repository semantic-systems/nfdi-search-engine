As a whole, the OER is amply broad to serve as the main textbook for an introductory course, yet each chapter is deep enough to be useful as a supplement for subject-area courses; authors use plain and accessible language as much as possible, but introduce more advanced, technical concepts where appropriate; the text gives due attention to the historical “canon” of mainstream criminological thought, but it also challenges many of these ideas by exploring alternative, critical, and marginalized perspectives. After all, criminology is more than just the study of crime and criminal law; it is an examination of the ways human societies construct, contest, and defend ideas about right and wrong, the meaning of justice, the purpose and power of laws, and the practical methods of responding to broken rules and of mending relationships.

http://dx.doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-15957,Simplified vortex methods to model wake vortex roll-up in real-time simulations for fuel-saving formation flight,http://dx.doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-15957,Henrik Spark; Robert Luckner,"One possibility for reducing fuel consumption is to fly in the upwind field of the wake vortex generated by an aircraft that is flying ahead. Migratory birds use this principle. Manually flying an aircraft at the point of optimal fuel reduction is not suited for routine flight operations as the pilot workload is excessively high. Hence, an autopilot function has to carry out this task. For designing the autopilot, a flight mechanical simulation with a wake vortex velocity model is required that has the ability to calculate the vortex-induced velocity fields. This paper contributes to the choice of a real-time simulation method for modelling vortex-induced velocities that the wake vortex of a leading aircraft generates and that the trailing aircraft shall use during fuel-saving formation flight.Two different wake vortex velocity models are introduced and compared during steady, horizontal flight. One model is based on the Lifting Line Method (LLM) and the other on the unsteady Vortex Lattice Method (VLM). Both models are able to calculate the wake vortex roll-up phase for arbitrary lift distributions, whereas the commonly used Single Horseshoe Vortex Model (SHVM) ignores the near-field roll up. The differences in the induced upwind distribution and vortex filament position are analysed for coarse spatial and temporal discretisation that the real-time constraint requires. Despite the more stringent simplifications of LLM, both methods yield similar filament positions and similar velocity fields for the same discretisation of the lifting surfaces. Finally, the influence of the discretisation parameters is discussed and parameter values are recommended for using VLM and LLM in real-time flight simulations.",2022-09-06T12:54:00Z,RESODATE,aHR0cDovL2R4LmRvaS5vcmcvMTAuMTQyNzkvZGVwb3NpdG9uY2UtMTU5NTc=,https://resodate.org/resources/aHR0cDovL2R4LmRvaS5vcmcvMTAuMTQyNzkvZGVwb3NpdG9uY2UtMTU5NTc=

Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether MI is required prior to LLM when analyzing longitudinal cost and effect data.Two-thousand complete datasets were simulated containing five time points. Incomplete datasets were generated with 10, 25, and 50% missing data in follow-up costs and effects, assuming a Missing At Random (MAR) mechanism. Six different strategies were compared using empirical bias (EB), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), and coverage rate (CR). These strategies were: LLM alone (LLM) and MI with LLM (MI-LLM), and, as reference strategies, mean imputation with LLM (M-LLM), seemingly unrelated regression alone (SUR-CCA), MI with SUR (MI-SUR), and mean imputation with SUR (M-SUR).For costs and effects, LLM, MI-LLM, and MI-SUR performed better than M-LLM, SUR-CCA, and M-SUR, with smaller EBs and RMSEs as well as CRs closers to nominal levels.

The effect of including Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) leaf meal (LLM) in broiler diets was investigated employing LLM at 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 g/kg diet. Experiments were also conducted to investigate whether reduced food intake of diets containing LLM is responsible for the growth depression. 2. LLM appears to be a good source of protein and calcium. 3. Food intake was not significantly affected (P>0.05) with dietary LLM inclusion up to 200 g/kg. 4. Inclusion of LLM up to 150 g/kg diet did not influence significantly (P>0.05) the performance of broilers in terms of body weight gain and food efficiency. However, inclusion of LLM at 200 g/kg diet had an adverse effect on weight gain and food efficiency, when compared to other dietary treatments. The profitability over food costs was low with the 200 g LLM/kg diet compared to those of other diets. 5.

Two AuNP dispersions at two pH values were applied to recognize and detect LLM-105 instead of traditional AuNP dispersion under an aptotic pH to improve the anti-interference ability. The developed assay showed excellent sensitivity with a detection limit of 3 ng/mL, and the presence of as low as 0.2 μg/mL LLM-105 can be directly detected with the bare eye.

The key conditions to cause transition between the fishbone mode and LLM are weak magnetic shear (for both monotonic and nonmonotonic safety factor profile) and plasma rotation. The fishbone mode can evolve into LLM only when rotating speed is bigger than a critical value in low shear plasmas. The critical beta of EIs to induce LLM is very low.

Molecular docking results of pharmacokinetic filtered molecules illustrated that five molecules had higher binding affinities than tunicamycin (TUM) and were stabled via non-covalent interactions (hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions) at the active site of LLM. Further, molecular dynamics results revealed that binding of identified antibacterial molecules with LLM resulted in stable LLM-inhibitor(s) complexes.

LLM contains organic nitrogen (N), ammonium, nitrate, and nitrite. The amount of nitrate and nitrite in LLM are usually small compared to the amount of ammonium in it and so they can be negligible if total nitrogen (N) concentration in LLM is higher than 1,000 mg L -1 . However, if total N concentration in LLM is less than 1,000 mg L -1 , the amount of nitrate and nitrite may affect total N concentration in LLM. Currently, Kjeldahl digestion method is mainly used for ammonium-N in LLM. Therefore, it is ineffective to analyze nitrate-N and nitrite-N. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the total N concentrations are affected by the amount of nitrate-N and nitrite-N with diverse LLMs by Kjeldahl method (with and without Devarda’s alloy after Conc. sulfuric acid digestion). Five liquid livestock manure samples were collected at swine farms in Ansung and Icheon. All LLM samples were stored at 25℃, subsampled at every 15 th day for 90 days, and analyzed for total N, ammonium-N, and nitrate-N. At the 90 th day, LLM samples were analyzed with and without Devarda’s alloy after Conc. sulfuric acid digestion. Potassium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, and ammonium chloride were used to determine the N recovery percentages. Total N concentration ranged from 560 to 4,230 mg L -1 . Nitrate-Ns were found in all LLM samples, ranged from 21 to 164 mg L -1 . N recovery percentages with potassium nitrate were 0 % without Devarda’s alloy and 100% with Devarda’s alloy because adding Devarda’s alloy facilitated nitrate-N into ammonium-N conversion. Total Ns were significantly different between two methods, with and without Devarda’s alloy. Total N concentrations were 210 mg L -1 at LLM 4 and 370 mg L -1 at LLM 5 without Devarda’s alloy and 290 mg L -1 at LLM 4 and 490 mg L -1 at LLM 5 with Devarda’s alloy.

In the first experiment, four castrated male pigs (average weight 20 kg) were randomly allotted to the four diets in a 4 x 4 latin square design, in order to evaluate the digestible components of the diets. Mean crude protein digestibility was significantly ( P   −1 ) compared with that of the control diet (0 g kg −1  LLM) and the diet containing a low level of LLM (100 g kg −1 ).

The present study was undertaken to determine the effect of LLM on cMyc, which is overexpressed in a subset of human prostate cancers. METHODS: The effect of LLM on cMyc expression and activity was determined by western blotting/confocal microscopy and luciferase reporter assay, respectively. A transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer (Hi-Myc) was used to determine chemopreventive efficacy of LLM. RESULTS: Exposure of androgen sensitive (LNCaP) and castration-resistant (22Rv1) human prostate cancer cells to LLM resulted in downregulation of protein and mRNA levels of cMyc. Overexpression of cMyc partially attenuated LLM-mediated inhibition of colony formation, cell viability, and cell migration in 22Rv1 and/or PC-3 cells. LLM treatment decreased protein levels of cMyc targets (e.g., lactate dehydrogenase), however, overexpression of cMyc did not attenuate these effects. A trend for a decrease in expression level of cMyc protein was discernible in 22Rv1 xenografts from LLM-treated mice compared with control mice.

It remains unclear whether this also applies to cost estimates from trial-based economic evaluations, that are generally right-skewed. Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether MI is required prior to LLM when analyzing longitudinal cost-effectiveness data.MethodsTwo-thousand complete datasets were simulated containing five time points. Incomplete datasets were generated with 10 percent, 25 percent, and 50 percent missing data in costs and effects, assuming a Missing At Random (MAR) mechanism. Statistical performance of six different methodological strategies was compared in terms of empirical bias (EB), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), and coverage rate (CR). Six strategies were compared: (i) LLM (LLM), (ii) MI prior to LLM (MI-LLM), (iii) mean imputation prior to LLM (M-LLM), (iv) complete-case analysis prior to seemingly unrelated regression (CCA-SUR), (v) MI prior to SUR (MI-SUR), and (vi) mean imputation prior to SUR (M-SUR). To evaluate the impact on the probability of cost-effectiveness at different willingness-to-pay [WTPs] thresholds, cost-effectiveness analyses were performed by applying the six strategies to two empirical datasets with 9% and 50% of missing data, respectively.ResultsFor costs and effects, LLM, MI-LLM, and MI-SUR performed better than M-LLM, CCA-SUR, and M-SUR, as indicated by smaller EBs and RMSEs, as well as CRs closer to the nominal levels of 0.95. However, even though LLM, MI-LLM, and MI-SUR performed equally well for effects, MI-LLM and MI-SUR were found to perform better than LLM for costs at 10 percent and 25 percent missing data. At 50 percent missing data, all strategies resulted in relatively high EBs and RMSEs for costs. In both empirical datasets, LLM, MI-LLM, and MI-SUR all resulted in similar probabilities of cost-effectiveness at different WTPs.ConclusionsWhen opting for using LLM for analyzing trial-based economic evaluation data, researchers are advised to multiply impute missing values first. Otherwise, MI-SUR may also be used.",2022-12-01,Openaire Products,doi_________::84ea748063a2d3f71b9637400ecf3d46,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462322002197

Thus, this study involves a detailed experimental study to reveal the mechanism of the two-step thermal decomposition of LLM-105. The results showed that LLM-105 decay was a consecutive reaction. The first-step reaction dominated the early stage of the LLM-105 decomposition, and its products participated in the reaction of the second step. The cleavage of NO2 and NH2 groups of LLM-105 mainly occurred in the first step, while gaseous products NO and C2N2 were released during the second reaction step. The first-step reaction had a higher oxygen consumption rate and a lower carbon consumption rate, producing more heat due to more extensive oxidation of the carbon backbone. The difference in the oxidative ability and reaction rate between the two steps resulted in a two-step exothermic and mass loss behavior.

LLMs are advantageous in offering the potential to enhance the generalizability as task-agnostic planners and facilitate flexible interaction between human instructors and planning systems. However, task plans generated by LLMs often lack feasibility and correctness. To address this challenge, we introduce ISR-LLM, a novel framework that improves LLM-based planning through an iterative self-refinement process. The framework operates through three sequential steps: preprocessing, planning, and iterative self-refinement. During preprocessing, an LLM translator is employed to convert natural language input into a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) formulation. In the planning phase, an LLM planner formulates an initial plan, which is then assessed and refined in the iterative self-refinement step by using a validator. We examine the performance of ISR-LLM across three distinct planning domains. The results show that ISR-LLM is able to achieve markedly higher success rates in task accomplishments compared to state-of-the-art LLM-based planners.

Introducing Information Retrieval (IR) to provide LLM with external knowledge is good potential to solve this problem. However, where and how to introduce IR into LLM is a big challenge. Previous work has the disadvantage that the wrong knowledge retrieved by IR misleads the LLM or breaks the reasoning chain of LLM. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Search-in-the-Chain (SearChain) for the interaction between LLM and IR to solve the challenges. First, LLM generates the global reasoning chain called Chain-of-Query (CoQ) where each node consists of an IR-oriented query and the answer to the query. Second, IR verifies the answer of each node of CoQ, it corrects the answer that is not consistent with the retrieved information when IR gives high confidence, which improves the credibility. Third, LLM can mark its missing knowledge in CoQ and IR can provide this knowledge to LLM. These three operations improve the accuracy of LLM for complex knowledge-intensive tasks in terms of reasoning ability and knowledge. Finally, SearChain generates the reasoning process and marks references to supporting documents for each reasoning step, which improves traceability. SearChain transforms the topology of reasoning from chain to tree, which can modify the reasoning direction. Experiment shows that SearChain outperforms baselines on complex knowledge-intensive tasks including multi-hop question-answering, slot filling, fact checking, and long-form question-answering.<br/>",2023-01-01,Openaire Products,doi_________::c2104523ce17641010f586f1f44651d5,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2304.14732

Van Zyl,"We study semiclassical string solutions that live on white regions of the LLM plane for a generic LLM geometry. These string excitations are labelled by conserved charges E, J and S and are thus holographically dual to operators in the SL(2) sector of N = 4 super-Yang Mills made up of covariant derivatives acting on complex scalar fields Z. On the other hand, the LLM geometry itself is dual to an operator consisting of O(N^2) Z-fields so that the operators dual to our solutions, containing both the stringy excitation and background, are non-planar. In an appropriate short string limit we argue that the string solution we find should be dual to a localised SL(2) excitation in the gauge theory language. This allows us to perform a non-trivial check of the recent proposal that the dynamics of localised excitations should be identical, up to a rescaling of the 't Hooft coupling, to the dynamics of those same excitations in the AdS5xS5 background<br/>10+3 pages<br/>",2018-09-01,Openaire Products,doi_dedup___::f63cd2733a961252db147ff354b575fb,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1805.12460

Their characterization can therefore provide insights into the structural and functional evolution of functional gene families. Phylogenetic and sequence analysis suggests that LLM-domain B-GATAs evolved from ancestral GATA transcription factors before the divergence of chlorophyte algae and Streptophyta. We compared the function of PpGATA1, a LLM-domain B-GATA gene in moss Physcomitrium patens, with Arabidopsis thaliana counterparts and showed that, in P. patens, PpGATA1 controls growth and greening in haploid gametophytes, while in transgenic Arabidopsis it affects germination, leaf development, flowering time, greening and light responses in diploid sporophytes. These PpGATA1 functions are similar to those of Arabidopsis counterparts, AtGNC, AtGNL and AtGATA17. PpGATA1 was able to complement the role of GNC and GNL in a gnc gnl double mutant, and the LLM domains of PpGATA1 and GNC behaved similarly. The functions of LLM-domain B-GATAs regulating hypocotyl elongation and cotyledon epinasty in flowering plants pre-exist before the divergence of mosses and the lineage leading to flowering plants. This study sheds light on adaption of PpGATA1 and its homologs to new developmental designs during the evolution.",2023-03-01,Openaire Products,doi_dedup___::f230cbacc7d0047b4251b437ce15428e,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2022.147103

LLMs are advantageous in offering the potential to enhance the generalizability as task-agnostic planners and facilitate flexible interaction between human instructors and planning systems. However, task plans generated by LLMs often lack feasibility and correctness. To address this challenge, we introduce ISR-LLM, a novel framework that improves LLM-based planning through an iterative self-refinement process. The framework operates through three sequential steps: preprocessing, planning, and iterative self-refinement. During preprocessing, an LLM translator is employed to convert natural language input into a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) formulation. In the planning phase, an LLM planner formulates an initial plan, which is then assessed and refined in the iterative self-refinement step by using a validator. We examine the performance of ISR-LLM across three distinct planning domains. The results show that ISR-LLM is able to achieve markedly higher success rates in task accomplishments compared to state-of-the-art LLM-based planners. Moreover, it also preserves the broad applicability and generalizability of working with natural language instructions.",2023-01-01,Openaire Products,doi_________::13aaf0342c6d9d19e39ae5a694bea8bc,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2308.13724

Introducing Information Retrieval (IR) to provide LLM with external knowledge is good potential to solve this problem. However, where and how to introduce IR into LLM is a big challenge. Previous work has the disadvantage that the wrong knowledge retrieved by IR misleads the LLM or breaks the reasoning chain of LLM. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Search-in-the-Chain (SearChain) for the interaction between LLM and IR to solve the challenges. First, LLM generates the global reasoning chain called Chain-of-Query (CoQ) where each node consists of an IR-oriented query and the answer to the query. Second, IR verifies the answer of each node of CoQ, it corrects the answer that is not consistent with the retrieved information when IR gives high confidence, which improves the credibility. Third, LLM can mark its missing knowledge in CoQ and IR can provide this knowledge to LLM. These three operations improve the accuracy of LLM for complex knowledge-intensive tasks in terms of reasoning ability and knowledge. Finally, SearChain generates the reasoning process and marks references to supporting documents for each reasoning step, which improves traceability. SearChain transforms the topology of reasoning from chain to tree, which can modify the reasoning direction. Experiment shows that SearChain outperforms baselines on complex knowledge-intensive tasks including multi-hop question-answering, slot filling, fact checking, and long-form question-answering.<br/>",2023-04-28,Openaire Products,arXiv_______::a9032a1b26b4691278d1daf0125c55df,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14732

We ascertained the relationship between low lean mass (LLM), obesity, and mortality and identified predictors in this subgroup. Methods A total of 4,984 subjects aged 60 years and older were identified from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004 linked to the National Death Index. LLM was defined using reduced appendicular lean mass (men < 19.75 kg; females < 15.02 kg). Obesity was defined using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry body fat (males ≥ 25%; females ≥ 35%). LLM with obesity was defined using criteria for both LLM and obesity. Proportional hazard models determined mortality risk for LLM and LLM with obesity, separately (referent = no LLM and no LLM with obesity, respectively). Results Mean age was 71.1 ± 0.19 years (56.5% female). Median follow-up was 102 months (interquartile range: 78, 124) with 1,901 deaths (35.0%). Prevalence of LLM with obesity was 33.5% in females and 12.6% in males. In those with LLM, overall mortality risk was 1.49 (1.27, 1.73) in males and 1.19 (1.02, 1.40) in females. Mortality risk in LLM with obesity was 1.31 (1.11, 1.55) and 0.99 (0.85, 1.16) in males and females, respectively. Age, diabetes, history of stroke, congestive heart failure, cancer, and kidney disease were predictive of death. Conclusions Risk of death is higher in subjects with LLM than with LLM and obesity.

To make LLM more than a query tool and to leverage its power in discovering natural and new laws of causality, we integrate the valuable LLM expertise on existing causal mechanisms into statistical analysis of objective data to build a novel and practical baseline for causal structure learning. We introduce a universal set of prompts designed to extract causal graphs from given variables and assess the influence of LLM prior causality on recovering causal structures from data. We demonstrate the significant enhancement of LLM expertise on the quality of recovered causal structures from data, while also identifying critical challenges and issues, along with potential approaches to address them.

The IS256 transposition created a new hybrid promoter in which the -35 region at the end of IS256 was properly arranged in relation to the -10-like sequence upstream of llm. The new promoters greatly enhanced the transcription of the mutant llm, as judged by blotting analysis of llm mRNA, with concomitant elevation of the methicillin resistance.

A pilot study was carried out to evaluate the effect of lipid infusion on the LLM index of the tracheal aspirates from ventilated neonates. All intubated infants were eligible for the study. Infants receiving parenteral nutrition had intravenous (IV) lipid introduced by 4-7 days of age; most samples after 7 days were from infants receiving IV lipid. Four infants received minimal gastric feeding; none had evidence of aspiration pneumonia. Tracheal aspirates from 28 infants were analyzed for the LLM index. Alveolar macrophages were graded 0-4 in direct relation to the amount of lipid per cell. One hundred macrophages were graded; the maximum possible LLM index was 400. Two hundred forty-five of 387 tracheal aspirate samples were acceptable for analysis. LLM indices increased during the first week after birth; the mean LLM index then continued in the same range, but with a wide distribution of individual values. The mean LLM index from infants receiving an IV lipid infusion during days 4-7 was 87.9 (SD = 44.8), and was significantly higher compared to 58.7 (SD = 40.8) in infants receiving no IV lipid (P0. 003).

To make LLM more than a query tool and to leverage its power in discovering natural and new laws of causality, we integrate the valuable LLM expertise on existing causal mechanisms into statistical analysis of objective data to build a novel and practical baseline for causal structure learning. We introduce a universal set of prompts designed to extract causal graphs from given variables and assess the influence of LLM prior causality on recovering causal structures from data. We demonstrate the significant enhancement of LLM expertise on the quality of recovered causal structures from data, while also identifying critical challenges and issues, along with potential approaches to address them.

Explosive reactivity under impact can be thought of in terms of safety (sensitiveness) and response to shock loading (sensitivity). The experimental work presented addresses both regimes, using hot-spot theory to support the observations made. The literature review discusses material properties that contribute to changes in sensitivity. This motivated modification of LLM-105 to provide different particle sizes and morphologies for assessment and comparison with other explosives. Impact sensitiveness is of particular interest for LLM-105 as there are some discrepancies in the literature data, owing to different methods being used to assess it in different countries and laboratories. Improved methods for characterising impact sensitiveness had to be developed in order to fully evaluate the LLM-105, enhancing a glass anvil drop-weight technique with multiple diagnostics, including high speed camera, mass spectrometer, photodiode and microphone. This equipment provided an ideal research tool for simultaneously assessing the reaction outputs of an explosive, and highlighted limitations of standard techniques used by industry. The characteristics of pristine and modified LLM-105 were evaluated using the drop-weight. It was found that particle size influenced reactive response, though presence of defects had a greater effect on initiation sensitiveness. Also, reaction growth was more strongly related to the particle shape and overall bulk density of the material, likely to be linked to packing efficiency of the particles. It was also found that LLM-105 was more sensitive to impact in general than previously thought, when compared to explosives such as HMX and TATB. The final chapter of this thesis examines LLM-105 behaviour under shock loading. LLM-105 was formulated with a fluoropolymer binder and detonated under a one dimensional shock regime with in-material gauge analysis. Data was acquired for two new LLM-105 formulations with respect to detonation velocity and growth of reaction within the explosive. The results showed that fine particle size LLM-105 has a shorter run distance to detonation than coarse, which is likely caused by the number of potential hot-spot sites available in voids within the pressed formulation.",2019-03-21,Openaire Products,doi_________::79104f9efc354ae562f14b129fcb9c90,https://doi.org/10.17863/cam.37925

However, such impressive capability typically comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in both the deployment, inference, and training stages. With LLM being a general-purpose task solver, we explore its compression in a task-agnostic manner, which aims to preserve the multi-task solving and language generation ability of the original LLM. One challenge to achieving this is the enormous size of the training corpus of LLM, which makes both data transfer and model post-training over-burdensome. Thus, we tackle the compression of LLMs within the bound of two constraints: being task-agnostic and minimizing the reliance on the original training dataset. Our method, named LLM-Pruner, adopts structural pruning that selectively removes non-critical coupled structures based on gradient information, maximally preserving the majority of the LLM's functionality. To this end, the performance of pruned models can be efficiently recovered through tuning techniques, LoRA, in merely 3 hours, requiring only 50K data. We validate the LLM-Pruner on three LLMs, including LLaMA, Vicuna, and ChatGLM, and demonstrate that the compressed models still exhibit satisfactory capabilities in zero-shot classification and generation.

Except for a few recent publications in melanoma, anticancer pharmacology of this interesting phytochemical is largely elusive. Leelamine (LLM) dose-dependently inhibited viability of MDA-MB-231 (triple-negative), MCF-7 (estrogen receptor-positive), and SUM159 (triple-negative) human breast cancer cells in association with apoptotic cell death induction. To the contrary, a normal mammary epithelial cell line derived from fibrocystic breast disease and spontaneously immortalized (MCF-10A) was fully resistant to LLM-mediated cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction. LLM also inhibited self-renewal of breast cancer stem cells. Apoptosis induction by LLM in breast cancer cells was accompanied by a modest increase in reactive oxygen species production, which was not due to inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes. Nevertheless, ectopic expression of manganese superoxide dismutase conferred partial protection against LLM-induced cell death but only at a lower yet pharmacologically relevant concentration. Exposure of breast cancer cells to LLM resulted in (a) induction and/or activation of multidomain proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak, (b) caspase-9 activation, and (c) cytosolic release of cytochrome c. Bax and Bak deficiency in immortalized fibroblasts conferred significant protection against cell death by LLM. Intraperitoneal administration of LLM (7.5 mg/kg; 5 times/wk) suppressed the growth of orthotopic SUM159 xenografts in mice without any toxicity.

Although plenty of endeavors have been dedicated to building valuable benchmarks, there is still little work aiming at evaluating the capability of LLM in multistep interactive environments. Noticing that LLM requires a text representation of the environment observations for interaction, we choose to fill such a blank by building a novel benchmark based on the information user interface (InfoUI). InfoUI consists of rich text contents and can be represented in some text formats, thus is suitable for the assessment of interaction ability of LLM. Additionally, the complex structures of InfoUI can further raise a challenge for LLM to understand structured texts rather than plain texts. An interaction platform is always used to evaluate an agent, however, there is still a lack of a satisfactory interaction platform dedicated to InfoUI. Consequently, we propose to build a novel easily-extendable, adaptable, and close-to-reality interaction platform, Mobile-Env, to provide a base for an appropriate benchmark. Based on Mobile-Env, an InfoUI task set WikiHow is then built to establish a benchmark for the multistep interaction capability of LLM in structured text-based environments. Agents based on a series of LLMs are tested on the task set to obtain an insight into the potential and challenge of LLM for InfoUI interaction. It is sincerely welcome that the community contribute new environments and new task sets for Mobile-Env to provide better test benchmarks and facilitate the development of the corresponding domains.",2023-05-14,Openaire Products,arXiv_______::3235d8ae3ffb819fb5106bbd4c553bff,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08144

In this paper, we propose the interactive robot action planning method that allows the LLM to analyze and gather missing information by asking questions to humans. The method can minimize the design cost of generating precise robot instructions. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our method through concrete examples in cooking tasks.

In submission<br/>Due to the recent improvements and wide availability of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have posed a serious threat to academic integrity in education. Modern LLM-generated text detectors attempt to combat the problem by offering educators with services to assess whether some text is LLM-generated. In this work, we have collected 124 submissions from computer science students before the creation of ChatGPT. We then generated 40 ChatGPT submissions. We used this data to evaluate eight publicly-available LLM-generated text detectors through the measures of accuracy, false positives, and resilience. The purpose of this work is to inform the community of what LLM-generated text detectors work and which do not, but also to provide insights for educators to better maintain academic integrity in their courses. Our results find that CopyLeaks is the most accurate LLM-generated text detector, GPTKit is the best LLM-generated text detector to reduce false positives, and GLTR is the most resilient LLM-generated text detector. We also express concerns over 52 false positives (of 114 human written submissions) generated by GPTZero. Finally, we note that all LLM-generated text detectors are less accurate with code, other languages (aside from English), and after the use of paraphrasing tools (like QuillBot). Modern detectors are still in need of improvements so that they can offer a full-proof solution to help maintain academic integrity. Further, their usability can be improved by facilitating a smooth API integration, providing clear documentation of their features and the understandability of their model(s), and supporting more commonly used languages.<br/>",2023-07-10,Openaire Products,arXiv_______::897da73248e7dcff876d5fc099855c1f,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07411

This paper introduces SpecInfer, an LLM serving system that accelerates generative LLM inference with speculative inference and token tree verification. A key insight behind Specinfer is to combine various collectively boost-tuned small language models to jointly predict the LLM's outputs; the predictions are organized as a token tree, whose nodes each represent a candidate token sequence. The correctness of all candidate token sequences represented by a token tree is verified against the LLM in parallel using a novel tree-based parallel decoding mechanism. SpecInfer uses an LLM as a token tree verifier instead of an incremental decoder, which significantly reduces the end-to-end latency and computational requirement for serving generative LLMs while provably preserving model quality. Our evaluation shows that SpecInfer outperforms existing LLM serving systems by 1.3-2.4x for distributed LLM inference and by 2.6-3.5x for offloading-based LLM inference, while preserving the same generative performance.

Lipophilic membrane (LLM) protein regulates bacterial lysis rate and methicillin resistance level in S. aureus. To identify potential lead molecules, we performed a structure-based pharmacophore modeling by consideration of pharmacophore properties from LLM-tunicamycin complex. Further, virtual screening of ZINC database against the LLM was conducted and compounds were assessed for Lipinski and ADMET properties. Based on pharmacokinetic, and molecular docking, five potential inhibitors (ZINC000072380005, ZINC000257219974, ZINC000176045471, ZINC000035296288, and ZINC000008789934) were identified. Molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) of these five molecules was performed to evaluate the dynamics and stability of protein after binding of the ligands. Several MDS analysis like RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, and PCA confirm that identified compounds exhibit higher binding affinity as compared to tunicamycin for LLM. The binding free energy analysis reveals that five compounds exhibit higher binding energy in the range of −218.76 to −159.52 kJ/mol, which is higher as compared to tunicamycin (–116.13 kJ/mol). Individual residue decomposition analysis concludes that Asn148, Asp151, Asp208, His271, and His272 of LLM play a significant role in the formation of lower energy LLM-inhibitor(s) complexes.

However they often ignore the modality-specific and modality-shared local feature matching. Modality-specific local matching could help extract discriminative identity-consistent features and alleviate spatial misalignment, and modality-shared local matching could make identity-consistent features be correlated in two modalities and mitigate the modality misalignment. Therefore, we establish the intra-modality and inter-modality co-occurrence relation between identity parts. We observe the modality-specific and modality-shared local feature matching of identity parts as intra-modality and inter-modality low-rank relation-finding problems. Therefore, in this work, we propose low-rank local matching (LLM) approach to establish the intra-modality and inter-modality co-occurrence relation between identity parts. First, in order to reinforce identity-consist features in two modalities and correlate these cross-modality identity-consist features together, the local matching (LM) module is designed to estimate partial co-occurrence probability by measuring local feature similarity. Moreover, we propose cross-modality triplet-center loss (CTLoss) which adds global constraint for each class distribution in embedding space to alleviate dramatic data expansion due to modality variance. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over the existing state-of-the-art.

Verilog is a popular hardware description language to model and design digital systems, thus generating Verilog code is a critical first step. Emerging large language models (LLMs) are able to write high-quality code in other programming languages. In this paper, we characterize the ability of LLMs to generate useful Verilog. For this, we fine-tune pre-trained LLMs on Verilog datasets collected from GitHub and Verilog textbooks. We construct an evaluation framework comprising test-benches for functional analysis and a flow to test the syntax of Verilog code generated in response to problems of varying difficulty. Our findings show that across our problem scenarios, the fine-tuning results in LLMs more capable of producing syntactically correct code (25.9% overall). Further, when analyzing functional correctness, a fine-tuned open-source CodeGen LLM can outperform the state-of-the-art commercial Codex LLM (6.5% overall).

LLM architecture, e.g., IBM Cell/B.E. is a purely distributed memory architecture in which each core can directly access only its small local memory, and that is why it is extremely power-efficient. Vector is a popular container class in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), which provides the functionality similar to a dynamic array. Due to the small non-virtualized memory in the LLM architecture, vector library implementation cannot be used as it is. In this paper, we propose and implement a scheme to manage vector class in the local memory present in each core of LLM multi-core architecture. Our scalable solution can transparently maintain vector data between the shared global memory and the local memories. In addition, different data transfer granularities are provided by our vector class to achieve better performance. We also propose a mechanism to ensure the validity of pointers-to-elements when the vector elements are moved into the global memory. Experimental result shows that our vector class can improve the programmability of vector class significantly while the overhead can be contained within 7%.",2011-10-27,IEEE,6062047,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6062047/

To facilitate full automation, most existing techniques aim to either increase coverage, or generate exploratory inputs. However, existing test generation techniques largely fall short of achieving more semantic objectives, such as generating tests to reproduce a given bug report. Reproducing bugs is nonetheless important, as our empirical study shows that the number of tests added in open source repositories due to issues was about 28% of the corresponding project test suite size. Meanwhile, due to the difficulties of transforming the expected program semantics in bug reports into test oracles, existing failure reproduction techniques tend to deal exclusively with program crashes, a small subset of all bug reports. To automate test generation from general bug reports, we propose Libro, a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs), which have been shown to be capable of performing code-related tasks. Since LLMs themselves cannot execute the target buggy code, we focus on post-processing steps that help us discern when LLMs are effective, and rank the produced tests according to their validity. Our evaluation of Libro shows that, on the widely studied Defects4J benchmark, Libro can generate failure reproducing test cases for 33% of all studied cases (251 out of 750), while suggesting a bug reproducing test in first place for 149 bugs. To mitigate data contamination (i.e., the possibility of the LLM simply remembering the test code either partially or in whole), we also evaluate Libro against 31 bug reports submitted after the collection of the LLM training data terminated: Libro produces bug reproducing tests for 32% of the studied bug reports.

In this paper, based on the powerful stacked generalization principle, a deep TSK fuzzy classifier (D-TSK-FC) is proposed to achieve the enhanced classification accuracy and triplely concise interpretability for fuzzy rules. D-TSK-FC consists of base-building units. Just like the existing popular deep learning, D-TSK-FC can be built in a layer-by-layer way. In terms of the stacked generalization principle, the training set plus random shifts obtained from random projections of prediction results of current base-building unit are presented as the input of the next base-building unit.

The output layer of each base-building unit can be learnt quickly by least learning machine (LLM). Besides, benefiting from LLM, D-TSK-FC's deep learning can be well scaled up for large datasets.

Among a wide variety of existing TSK fuzzy systems, most of them are driven by special knowledge since the learned parameters of each fuzzy rule are totally different. However, common knowledge is equally important and useful in practice and hence a TSK fuzzy system embedded with common knowledge should be more intuitive and interpretable when tackling with real-world problems. In this paper, we propose a common and special knowledge-driven TSK fuzzy system (CSK-TSK-FS), in which the parameters corresponding to each feature in then-parts of fuzzy rules always keep invariant and these parameters are viewed as common knowledge. As for its modeling, except the gradient descent techniques and other existing training algorithms, we can obtain a trained CSK-TSK-FS from a trained GMM or a trained FLNN because the proposed fuzzy system CSK-TSK-FS is mathematically equivalent to a special GMM and a FLNN. CSK-TSK-FS has three characteristics: (1) with the classical centroid defuzzification strategy, the involved common knowledge can be separated from fuzzy rules such that the interpretability of CSK-TSK-FS can be enhanced; (2) it can be trained quickly by the proposed LLM-based training algorithm; (3) the equivalence relationships among CSK-TSK-FS, GMM and FLNN allow them to share some commonality in training such that the proposed LLM-based training algorithm provides a novel fast training tool for training GMM and FLNN.

However, effective utilization of LLMs for zero-shot visual question-answering (VQA) remains challenging, primarily due to the modality disconnect and task disconnect between the LLM and VQA tasks. End-to-end training on multimodal data may bridge the disconnects, but is inflexible and computationally expensive. To address this issue, we propose Img2LLM, a plug-and-play module that provides LLM prompts to enable LLMs to perform zeroshot VQA tasks without end-to-end training. We develop LLM-agnostic models describe image content as exemplar question-answer pairs, which prove to be effective LLM prompts.

Furthermore, for embedded applications, where the maximum heap size can be known at compile time, we propose optimizations on the heap management to significantly improve the application performance.

Our algorithm achieves an approximation factor of O(n/√log n), improving on the previous best of O(n1.5) due to Lag arias, Lenstra, and Schnorr [1]. We also show, somewhat surprisingly, that only O(n) vectors of preprocessing advice are sufficient to solve the problem (with the slightly worse approximation factor of O(n)). We remark that this still leaves a large gap with respect to the decisional version of CVPP, where the best known approximation factor is O(√n/log n) due to Aharonov and Regev [2]. To achieve these results, we show a reduction to the same problem restricted to target points that are close to the lattice and a more efficient reduction to a harder problem, Bounded Distance Decoding with preprocessing (BDDP). Combining either reduction with the previous best-known algorithm for BDDP by Liu, Lyubashevsky, and Micciancio [3] gives our main result. In the setting of CVP without preprocessing, we also give a reduction from (1+∈)γ approximate CVP to γ approximate CVP where the target is at distance at most 1+1/∈ times the minimum distance (the length of the shortest non-zero vector) which relies on the lattice sparsification techniques of Dadush and Kun [4]. As our final and most technical contribution, we present a substantially more efficient variant of the LLM algorithm (both in terms of run-time and amount of preprocessing advice), and via an improved analysis, show that it can decode up to a distance proportional to the reciprocal of the smoothing parameter of the dual lattice [5].

Landgraf; Marcos F. de Campos,"To explain the magnetic behavior of plastic deformation of thin magnetic films (Fe and permalloy) on an elastic substrate (nitinol), it is noted that unlike in the bulk, the dislocation density does not increase dramatically because of the dimensional constraint. As a result, the resulting residual stress, even though strain hardening is limited, dominates the observed magnetic behavior. Thus, with the field parallel to the stress axis, the compressive residual stress resulting from plastic deformation causes a decrease in remanence and an increase in coercivity; and with the field perpendicular to the stress axis, the resulting compressive residual stress causes an increase in remanence and a decrease in coercivity. These elements have been inserted into the model previously developed for plastic deformation in the bulk, producing the aforementioned behavior, which has been observed experimentally in the films.",2010-01-19,IEEE,5393184,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5393184/

Previous methods ignore a significant specificity of the task: the difficulty of RSICC is different for unchanged and changed image pairs. They process the unchanged and changed image pairs in a coupled way, which usually causes confusion for change captioning. In this article, we decouple the task into two issues to ease it: whether and what changes have occurred. An image-level classifier performs binary classification to address the first issue. A feature-level encoder contributes to extracting discriminative features to help the caption generation module address the second issue. Besides, for caption generation, we utilize prompt learning to introduce pretrained large language models (LLMs) into the RSICC task. A multiprompt learning strategy is proposed to generate a set of unified prompts and a class-specific prompt conditioned on the image-level classifier’s results. The strategy can prompt a pretrained LLM to know whether changes exist and generate captions. Finally, the multiple prompts and the visual features of the feature-level encoder are fed into a frozen LLM for language generation. Compared with previous methods, our method can leverage the powerful abilities of the pretrained LLM in language to generate plausible captions, which is free of training. Extensive experiments show that our method is effective and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Besides, an additional experiment demonstrates that our decoupling paradigm is more promising than the previous coupled paradigm for the RSICC task.

Most of the LLM techniques and equipment - which are still in operation nowadays - were developed by Dr. Béla Csikós, who was one of the pioneers of high voltage live-line work. In those days the live maintainability of the power lines was a significant aspect during the design of towers and insulator strings. Contrarily, structures change year-by-year, especially regarding the insulators. Therefore, live working methods also shall be developed. Nowadays, new types of tower structures and insulator strings are used with reduced distances, which also means reduced clearance between the different potentials in the arrangement.

Moreover, there is no uniform standard and international practice for the regulation of safety clearances. New type of mounting chair made of non-conductive material is suitable for approaching the insulator strings and their fittings safely, as the air gap between the conductive parts does not shorten.

Injuries of birds related to electrocution endanger both the health of the different species and the reliability of the grid as well. International standards and national regulations based on the opinion of different associations for wildlife protection are often been accepted without any detailed inspection of equipment to be installed on the network. There are many types of insulators, cross-arms and poles even in a specific section of a medium voltage power line. The same type of rigid bird protector installed on them can easily increase the risk of failures caused by the wrong way of application or installation. A rigid bird protector - especially in case of rainy weather conditions or fog - acts as a floating object near the phase conductors. This electrode distorts the electric field distribution even in case of normal operational conditions and increase the risk of flashovers on the surface of the insulators caused by an overvoltage wave in the conductors. Use of conductor and insulator covers are also questionable from the aspect of live-line maintenance (LLM): inspection of working site became impossible and electrical and mechanical condition cannot been estimated at all. Operations with the hot stick method - which is a widely used LLM technique for example in Hungary - became especially difficult. Inspection of different bird protective equipment from electrical aspect is a very important question to keep the operation of medium voltage grids as reliable as possible. In the High Voltage Laboratory of Budapest University of Technology and Economics calculations, finite element simulations of electric field and potential on complex 3D CAD models and a set of measurements have been executed to inspect the exact effects of these equipment from the aspect of the reliability of the grid. Experimental studies in Hungary show that many failures are related to rigid bird protectors. There are often detectable marks on the surface of both the phase conductors and insulators. There are many bird protector-related switch-offs on the territory of different Hungarian DSOs, so the clarification of unexplained questions about this practical topic is urgent and become more and more important.",2014-10-23,IEEE,6934383,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6934383/

In this work, we provide a novel perspective on using an LLM to provide text supervision for a zero-shot image classification model.

This principle of shielding electric fields is not effective against magnetic fields. Results of calculations, simulations and measurements prove that in some cases induced magnetic fields in the body of the live-line worker exceed the current limits defined by ICNIRP.

Bastian; Alvaro Velasquez; Sandeep Neema,"Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have been trained to generate human-like responses to natural language prompts. LLMs use a vast corpus of text data for training, and can generate coherent and contextually relevant responses to a wide range of questions and statements. Despite this remarkable progress, LLMs are prone to hallucinations making their application to safety-critical applications such as autonomous systems difficult. The hallucinations in LLMs refer to instances where the model generates responses that are not factually accurate or contextually appropriate. These hallucinations can occur due to a variety of factors, such as the model’s lack of real-world knowledge, the influence of biased or inaccurate training data, or the model’s tendency to generate responses based on statistical patterns rather than a true understanding of the input. While these hallucinations are a nuisance in tasks such as text summarization and question-answering, they can be catastrophic when LLMs are used in autonomy-relevant applications such as planning. In this paper, we focus on the application of LLMs in autonomous systems and sketch a novel self-monitoring and iterative prompting architecture that uses formal methods to detect these errors in the LLM response automatically.

However, this method leads to failure of ZVS in the light load condition. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved control scheme with two modes for single-phase ARSI to achieve ZVS from zero load to full load. In heavy load mode (HLM), half of main switches are turned on at ZVS condition by using the output current to reduce the conduction loss. In light load mode (LLM), all the main switches achieve ZVS with the conduction of resonant branch to solve the problem of the failure of ZVS near zero load current. Besides, the auxiliary switches can operate at zero-current-switching (ZCS) condition. The proposed control scheme was first verified in the simulation and then validated in the experiment with an inverter prototype. The results show that the proposed control scheme can make main switches achieve ZVS from zero load to full load.",2016-07-14,IEEE,7512469,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7512469/

We show that utilizing these detailed descriptions instead of the original action phrases leads to better alignment of text and motion spaces. We introduce a generic approach compatible with stochastic (e.g. VAE-based) and deterministic (e.g. MotionCLIP) text-to-motion models.

Dirty lines in write-back data caches are more critical, since the dirty lines have no backups in lower-level memory (LLM). This paper provides a write-buffer scheme for backing up dirty lines to protect cache memories based on the replication mechanism combined with interleaving parity check against multiple-bit errors. The write-buffer contains two same replication caches to replicate the dirty data from the original cache, and the two replication caches take turns to write the replicated data back to LLM during the free time when there is no access in LLM. In this way, the dirty data in original cache is backed up to LLM that can be used for error recovery, and meanwhile, spaces of the replication caches are released to replicate new dirty data; moreover, the writebacks of the replicated data can be performed in the background without extra clocks. Simulation results show that the proposed write-buffer scheme can provide a full protection for caches without degrading system performance, while it can improve the system performance by an average of 1.4% due to the background writebacks, and compared with state-of-the-art replication-based technique, it can increase the replication capability by 11.6% and save 6.2% energy consumption in case of the optimal configuration.

In the usual approach, an answer is generated by a single call to an LLM, but it has been pointed out that the performance of multi-hop inference by LLMs is not sufficient. Thus, an LLM is unable to perform the complex processing necessary to get an answer, which leads to poor performance. Moreover, the inference process is opaque. Against this, approaches that call an LLM multiple times have been proposed, but many of these approaches can only be used for a limited number of effective tasks, and LLMs essentially require complex processing.To address these problems, we propose the Exploratory Inference Chain (EIC) framework that combines the implicit processing of LLMs with explicit inference chains, and this is based on the dual process theory of human cognitive processes. The EIC framework first generates the information needed to answer a multi-hop question as keywords and then performs 1-hop inference for each keyword. If the inference is not sufficient, additional inferences are performed. This process is repeated, and when sufficient inferences are obtained, they are aggregated, and the final answer is generated. This makes the information per inference by LLM simplified, and logical inference is achieved through an explicit inference chain.We conducted experiments on two multi-hop QA datasets and confirmed through a quantitative evaluation that our EIC framework performed better than existing approaches. Moreover, a qualitative evaluation confirmed that our approach can effectively perform inference so as to get closer to the answer in question-answering tasks that require knowledge. In addition, compared with existing approaches, the EIC framework improves the interpretability of the output.",2023-03-20,IEEE,10066644,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10066644/

In this paper, a class-based correction is proposed for normalizing each class in ScanSAR data to a nominal incidence angle. Two tested sea ice synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data sets were acquired: a data set for the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, which was obtained by the RADARSAT-2 satellite, and a data set for the Bohai Sea, which was obtained by the ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar. An unsupervised classification is performed on each image block prior to normalization, and the incidence angle range of each image block is approximately 5°. Because the distribution of the backscatter coefficients in the azimuth band is discrete and nonlinear, the class-based locally linear mapping (LLM) technique is implemented, based on the assumption that a small quantity of sorted backscatter coefficients is locally linear. This algorithm is a transplantable and easily applied method that requires limited ground data, and it is also a semiautomated technique because nearly all of its parameters can be adaptively determined during the image analysis. The results demonstrate that LLM-corrected ScanSAR images appear to have more detailed textures, and the natural signal variability in the radar data is preserved, which indicates that the LLM produces better results compared with the histogram-based-alike (HIST-alike) technique when correcting the incidence angle in the sea ice SAR data. The results of the data analysis in this paper show that the width of the azimuth band should be selected based on the extent of variation in the incidence angle, and the reference band can be calculated based on the maximum interclass distance principle. The intercomparisons also reveal that the proposed algorithm can improve the accuracy of supervised classifications.",2016-01-22,IEEE,7390041,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7390041/

To avoid being infected by malicious or compromised targets, state-of-the-art system integrity monitors rely on virtualization technology to set up a tamper-proof execution environment. Consequently, the virtualization infrastructure is part of the trusted computing base. However, modern virtual machine monitors are complex entities, with large code bases that are difficult to verify. In this paper, we present a new machine architecture called limited local memory (LLM), which we use to set up an alternative tamper-proof execution environment for system integrity monitors. This architecture builds upon recent trends in multicore chip design to equip each processing core with access to a small, private memory area. We show that the features of the LLM architecture, combined with a novel secure paging mechanism, suffice to bootstrap a tamper-proof execution environment without support for hardware virtualization. We demonstrate the utility of this architecture by building a rootkit detector that leverages the key features of LLM.

This LLM model recognizes the relationship between the need for operating a base-loaded unit and the system load cycle. A comparison of the results obtained by using a traditional production costing method, the OPCOST method with explicit consideration of unit duty cycle effects, and the new method using the LLM model for base-loaded units, called the PROCOP method, shows significant differences in the energies produced by the base-loaded units and consequently the other units. The linkage of a base-loaded unit's need for operation to the load cycle avoids the assumption of the traditional model that the base-loaded units are equally needed all times. It also avoids the ad hoc treatment of outage postponability of base-loaded units. Hence, the PROCOP method is more physically based and is likely to be more accurately responsive to change in the load cycle and other system parameters.<>",2002-08-06,IEEE,65908,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/65908/

We retrofit the automation system for a modular production facility and create executable control interfaces of fine-granular functionalities and coarse-granular skills. Low-level functionalities are executed by automation components, and high-level skills are performed by automation modules. Subsequently, a digital twin system is developed, registering these interfaces and containing additional descriptive information about the production system. Based on the retrofitted automation system and the created digital twins, LLM-agents are designed to interpret descriptive information in the digital twins and control the physical system through service interfaces. These LLM-agents serve as intelligent agents on different levels within an automation system, enabling autonomous planning and control of flexible production. Given a task instruction as input, the LLM-agents orchestrate a sequence of atomic functionalities and skills to accomplish the task. We demonstrate how our implemented prototype can handle un-predefined tasks, plan a production process, and execute the operations.

NLMap serves as a framework to gather and integrate contextual information into LLM planners, allowing them to see and query available objects in the scene before generating a context-conditioned plan. NLMap first establishes a natural language queryable scene representation with Visual Language models (VLMs). An LLM based object proposal module parses instructions and proposes involved objects to query the scene representation for object availability and location. An LLM planner then plans with such information about the scene. NLMap allows robots to operate without a fixed list of objects nor executable options, enabling real robot operation unachievable by previous methods.

Inspired by the fact that the pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) has made outstanding progress in text generation, we propose an approach named QTypist based on LLM for intelligently generating semantic input text according to the GUI context. To boost the performance of LLM in the mobile testing scenario, we develop a prompt-based data construction and tuning method which automatically extracts the prompts and answers for model tuning. We evaluate QTypist on 106 apps from Google Play, and the result shows that the passing rate of QTypist is 87%, which is 93% higher than the best baseline.

With its promising classification performance, DBN-TSK-FC features sharing both the powerful neural representation ability of a DBN and the strong uncertainty-handling capability of an interpretable fuzzy representation. On the one hand, DBN-TSK-FC builds its interpretable fuzzy representation in a hierarchical way by applying the classical fuzzy clustering algorithm FCM to obtain fuzzy partitions on the training dataset. Then, it forms interpretable antecedent parts of fuzzy rules as the corresponding fuzzy representation. On the other hand, DBN-TSK-FC builds its DBN-based neural representation in the other hierarchical way. That is, it applies the existing unsupervised DBN pretraining on the training dataset and then takes the neural representation of all the hidden nodes in the top layer of the corresponding DBN as the set of consequent variables of fuzzy rules. In this approach, both the interpretable fuzzy representation and the DBN-based neural representation are further fused to form the corresponding fuzzy rules quickly by using the least learning machine (LLM) on both the fuzzy rules and the labeling information of the original dataset. Therefore, DBN-TSK-FC is essentially a deep TSK fuzzy classifier from the perspective of fuzzy rules, and it indeed avoids the very slow fine-tuning training required after the unsupervised pretraining of the existing DBN learning.

A major problem in image recognition is that the recognition performance is degraded by geometric variations such as that in position and size of the object to be recognized. SL-HMMs have been proposed to solve this problem. SL-HMMs are an extension of HMMs with size and locational invariances based on state transitions. An SL-HMM is a generative model and can represent generation processes of observations well. However, there is a possibility that the recognition performance of generative models is inferior to that of discriminative models because discriminative models are specialized to identification. In this paper, we propose image recognition based on log linear models (LLMs) using features extracted from SL-HMMs. The proposed method can extract features invariant to geometric variations by using SL-HMMs and built an accurate classifier based on discriminative models with the extracted features. Face recognition experiments showed that the proposed method obtained higher recognition rates than SL-HMMs and convolutional neural networks based methods.",2017-06-19,IEEE,7952628,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7952628/

ERRA is based on tightly-coupled probabilistic inferences at two granularity levels. Coarse-resolution inference is formulated as sequence generation through a large language model, which infers action language from natural language instruction and environment state. The robot then zooms to the fine-resolution inference part to perform the concrete action corresponding to the action language. Fine-resolution inference is constructed as a Markov decision process, which takes action language and environmental sensing as observations and outputs the action. The results of action execution in environments provide feedback for subsequent coarse-resolution reasoning. Such coarse-to-fine inference allows the robot to decompose and achieve long-horizon tasks interactively. In extensive experiments, we show that ERRA can complete various long-horizon manipulation tasks specified by abstract language instructions.

However, the boundaries of the SI concepts are becoming blurry and shifting due to technological and economic factors, globalization and interdependence between countries and firms. Previous literature has limitations to address shifting boundaries by assessing SI literature holistically. This study set out to understand the overlaps of SI concepts. It aims at delimiting the SI field, delineating boundaries and at determining the topics underlying the SI and overlaps. Context-specific synergies become transparent, enabling decision-makers and researchers to consider economic interrelationships in a topic-specific and cross-system perspective. The study uses deep learning in combination with natural language processing on data consisting of 2380 SI literature related article abstracts retrieved from Web of Science and EBSCO research databases to capture the semantic context of topics, whereas external information is used to cross-validate interrelationships and to observe topic distribution. The findings reveal significant proportions of overlaps between SI apart from regional and technological systems. Various topics that are discussed within the SI literature such as industrial clusters and structures is a common topic for all SI. This illustrates that economic topics are contextually or theoretically not bound to a system but distributed across the entire literature. We therefore provide a structured framework to illustrate SI overlaps and to address topic synergies.

The oracle problem is a major challenge in testing such systems, where it is difficult to determine whether or not the output of a system is correct. Metamorphic testing (MT) can alleviate this problem by checking the consistency of the system’s outputs under various transformations. However, manual generation of MRs is often a time-consuming and error-prone process. Automated MR generation can yield several benefits, including enhanced efficiency, quality, coverage, scalability, and reusability in software testing, thereby facilitating a more comprehensive and effective testing process. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT for automatic generation of MRs for ADSs. We provide a detailed methodology for generating MRs using ChatGPT and evaluate the generated MRs using our domain knowledge and existing MRs. The results of our study indicate that our proposed approach is effective at generating high-quality MRs, and can significantly reduce the manual effort required for MR generation. Furthermore, we discuss the practical implications and limitations of using ChatGPT for MR generation and provide recommendations for future research.

In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy DBN system called TSK_DBN which combines DBN and TSK fuzzy system. Firstly, the fuzzy clustering algorithm FCM is used to divide the input space, and the membership function of the fuzzy rule is defined. Then, the implicit feature is created by DBN. Finally, the consequent parameters of the fuzzy rule are determined by LLM(Least Learning Machine). The TSK_DBN fuzzy system has an adaptive mechanism, which can automatically adjust the depth until the optimal accuracy is achieved. The prominent character of the TSK_DBN system is that there is adaptive mechanism to regulate the depth of DBN to get a high accuracy. Several benchmark datasets have been used to empirically evaluate the efficiency of the proposed TSK_DBN in handling pattern classification tasks. The results show that the accuracy rates of TSK_DBN are at least comparable (if not superior) to DBN system with distinctive ability in providing explicit knowledge in the form of high interpretable rule base.",2018-01-15,IEEE,8258762,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8258762/

In this article, a nonintrusive computational strategy for iterative solution to the nonlinear behavior in the subdomains is proposed. To estimate the residual force on the interface connecting the subdomains with nonmatching discretizations, variational principles with an intermediate framework are proposed to assure satisfaction of virtual work principle in the subdomains and to assure displacement/traction compatibility at the interface. To map nodal force from one subdomain to the other, both global Lagrange multiplier (GLM) and local Lagrange multiplier (LLM) methods are discussed. Quasi-Newton iterative updates are used to correct displacements on the interface connecting the different subdomains until equilibrium is reached. A symmetric rank 1 update as well as the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) update are considered for accelerating the solution convergence. The developed method is suitable for the modular construction of submodels with nonmatching discretizations and even allows coupling between subdomains analyzed using different (commercial or custom) codes. The iterative global–local coupling strategy is validated on several examples, including an L-shaped domain with local nonlinearity and a rectangular plate with a propagating crack. Another example illustrating the coupling of domains independently analyzed using commercial finite element codes ANSYS and ABAQUS is next demonstrated.

However, current state-of-the-art traditional and learning-based APR techniques face the problem of limited patch variety, failing to fix complicated bugs. This is mainly due to the reliance on bug-fixing datasets to craft fix templates (traditional) or directly predict potential patches (learning-based). Large Pre-Trained Language Models (LLMs), trained using billions of text/code tokens, can potentially help avoid this issue. Very recently, researchers have directly leveraged LLMs for APR without relying on any bug-fixing datasets. Meanwhile, such existing work either failed to include state-of-the-art LLMs or was not evaluated on realistic datasets. Thus, the true power of modern LLMs on the important APR problem is yet to be revealed. In this work, we perform the first extensive study on directly applying LLMs for APR. We select 9 recent state-of-the-art LLMs, including both generative and infilling models, ranging from 125M to 20B in size. We designed 3 different repair settings to evaluate the different ways we can use LLMs to generate patches: 1) generate the entire patch function, 2) fill in a chunk of code given the prefix and suffix 3) output a single line fix. We apply the LLMs under these repair settings on 5 datasets across 3 different languages and compare different LLMs in the number of bugs fixed, generation speed and compilation rate. We also compare the LLMs against recent state-of-the-art APR tools. Our study demonstrates that directly applying state-of-the-art LLMs can already substantially outperform all existing APR techniques on all our datasets. Among the studied LLMs, the scaling effect exists for APR where larger models tend to achieve better performance. Also, we show for the first time that suffix code after the buggy line (adopted in infilling-style APR) is important in not only generating more fixes but more patches with higher compilation rate. Besides patch generation, the LLMs consider correct patches to be more natural than other ones, and can even be leveraged for effective patch ranking or patch correctness checking. Lastly, we show that LLM-based APR can be further substantially boosted via: 1) increasing the sample size, and 2) incorporating fix template information.",2023-07-14,IEEE,10172803,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10172803/

Intent-based infrastructure management is a means to simplify management by allowing users to specify intents, i.e., high-level statements in natural language, that are automatically realized by the system. However, providing intent-based multi-domain infrastructure management poses a number of challenges: 1) intent translation; 2) plan execution and parallelization; 3) incompatible cross-domain abstractions. To tackle these challenges, we propose AppleSeed, an intent-based infrastructure management system that enables an end-to-end intent-to-deployment pipeline. AppleSeed uses few-shot learning for training a Large Language Model (LLM) to translate intents into intermediate programs, which are processed by a just-in-time compiler and a materialization module to automatically generate parallelizable, domain-specific executable programs. We evaluate the system in two use cases: Deep Packet Inspection (DPI); and machine learning training and inferencing. Our system achieves efficient intent translation into an execution plan with an average 22.3x lines of code to intent word ratio. It also speeds up the execution of the management plan by 1.7-2.6 times with our JIT compilation for parallelized execution compared to sequential execution.",2023-07-13,IEEE,10175410,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10175410/

The research also delves into Model Attribution, encompassing source model identification, model family classification, and model size classification. Our results reveal several key findings: a clear inverse relationship between classifier effectiveness and model size, with larger LLMs being more challenging to detect, especially when the classifier is trained on data from smaller models. Training on data from similarly sized LLMs can improve detection performance from larger models but may lead to decreased performance when dealing with smaller models. Additionally, model attribution experiments show promising results in identifying source models and model families, highlighting detectable signatures in LLM-generated text. Overall, our study contributes valuable insights into the interplay of model size, family, and training data in LLM detection and attribution.",2023-09-23,Zenodo,10024112,https://zenodo.org/records/10024112

Insider trading, epitomizing both unethical and illicit conduct, manifests as transactions carried out in the clandestine shadows of privileged knowledge, conveniently shielded from the public eye. This nefarious practice invariably gnaws at the bedrock of trust underpinning our capital market, imposing a deleterious toll on its expansion and the overarching economic equilibrium. The discourse meticulously unravels the immediate aftermath of insider trading, encompassing the distortion of market efficiency, the alarming erosion of investor faith, and the emergence of a skewed arena wherein a privileged few capitalise on the unsuspecting majority. The indirect ramifications extend to a contraction in market liquidity and a surge in risk, as investors, burdened with trepidation, retract their funds, or withhold future investments. The treatise attempts to quantify the fiscal erosion engendered by insider trading in India, transcending mere market capitalisation, and encompassing its broader ramifications on economic proliferation. The discourse elucidates how insider trading deters the influx of foreign direct investments (FDI), thereby tarnishing India's allure as an investment haven. The analysis further traverses the labyrinth of regulatory frameworks erected to thwart insider trading in India and their effectiveness. It accentuates the urgent imperative for rigorous enforcement of existing statutes, an enhancement of corporate governance standards, and an escalation of investor awareness to engender a more transparent and equitable financial milieu. In summation, this analysis emerges as an exhaustive compendium elucidating the pervasive fallout of insider trading on India's macroeconomic fabric and individual investors, while proffering strategic countermeasures to this scourge. It beckons our policymakers, regulators, and stakeholders to orchestrate a collective, concerted endeavour to fortify India's capital markets and secure their sustainable trajectory.",2023-05-18,Zenodo,7952359,https://zenodo.org/records/7952359

In India, crimes against the senior citizen have been increasing rapidly. Today, they are mostly the victims of various crimes like murder, serious injuries, cheating  and brutality and they are unattainable to other family members and neighbours due to lack of neighbourhood involvement, dependence on others, family violence, vulnerability, defensibility etc. These incidents attract the academicians as well as the policy makers to pay notice to the various dimensions of these crimes. There is a higher danger to the life of the senior citizens in our nation. The senior citizens have not been tossed out of the standard as far as possible however they are left without any assets and are seen powerless in their homes. Movement, urbanization, industrialization and globalization has obsessed scrambling of space in the urban communities, in this manner the senior citizen are abandoned by their little youngsters so they can keep up their ideal ways of life. Crime against the senior citizen such as murder, financial crimes, fraud, and burglary are the most common. Criminals consider the elderly people as easy targets because they are physically fragile and they are less able to shield or care for themselves. The senior citizens are considered as the bastions of our nation.

Every government system follows the principle of ultimate powers in divided authorities responsible to promote public welfare and safety through constitutional practice of economic freedom. Pharmacoeconomics deals with cost-effective analysis in alignment with administrative functions of the government in relation to ethical behavior of private companies to comply with the rules and regulations expressed by the legislation and its comparative parliamentary legal system for guidance and control of appropriate ethical conduct as advocated by warranty issues of intellectual property. The intended design of PDE-5 inhibitors for marketing their products for public use as medication is indicated in their patent registration as strict compliance of advocating patient safety. Hence, ethical issues on product warranty of declared intended use, health risks for economic benefit, sexuality, and gender as socio-legal utilization of resources, empirical healthcare practice based on registered declared intellectual property of product design, and economic interventions in advocacy of constitutional monetary freedom are aimed to be discussed and resolved in this paper. Public funds are used by the government to advocate cost-effective analysis in pharmacoeconomics. Therefore, direct taxation of product services and practice of health promotion must be properly addressed and coordination in aligning the institutional goals with employment law for proper compliance of handling patented products. Furthermore, indirect taxation based on public funds must resolve issues concerning taxes collected from private companies handling patented drug products with clear specification of intended design for patient efficacy and safety. It is recommended to provide ways of promoting pharmacoeconomics without the conflict of suffering the declared intellectual property design for handling and misleading the acquired taxes for public funds, which in turn will also be compensated for unregistered intellectual property design based on patent law.

10.5281/zenodo.8245421,Reproductive Choice of a Woman: A Fundamental Right,https://zenodo.org/api/records/8245421,Vishnu C H; Megha S,"Human rights law stipulates that women must be free to decide when to be pregnant, how many children to have, and how to space pregnancies. Laws and policies that deny women and girls their sexual and reproductive health rights are inherently discriminatory. States should respect the capacity of women and girls for autonomous decision-making and not limit the access to contraceptives to the obtention of the authorisation of husbands, partners or parents of girls . The right of women to exercise their reproductive choice is implicitly protected as the fundamental right under the Indian Constitution. Indian courts play a crucial role in preventing and addressing the ongoing violation of these women rights. Women always possess particular rights which shouldn’t be denied at any cause. One such right is her right to exercise her reproductive choice. All of us have a right to body autonomy, which means we should be able to make decisions about our bodies on our own. In our society, women and girls are often denied reproductive choices. It is not only immoral and discriminatory, but it also infringes on their basic human rights, including the right to life and dignity. It adds to disparity and violence. The right of reproductive choices is a basic fundamental right that should be granted to all without question and with dignity. With the passage of time, tremendous progress in implementing reproductive health has been made. There is still a long way to go in fully acknowledging reproductive rights. The ultimate purpose of the right to reproduction is the individual's well-being and thus everyone should be able to freely exercise their reproductive choice. Not only will better approach to reproductive health assist women, but it will also benefit society as a whole. Men, particularly spouses, must come out in support, accept their wives consent, and participate equally in the decision-making process. The government must ensure proper reproductive health as well as reproductive information and education to safeguard the individual’s rights and promote wellbeing and a healthy lifestyle. This will, in turn, benefit the country’s growth and development.",2023-07-31,Zenodo,8245421,https://zenodo.org/records/8245421

Laws and policies that deny women and girls their sexual and reproductive health rights are inherently discriminatory. States should respect the capacity of women and girls for autonomous decision-making and not limit the access to contraceptives to the obtention of the authorisation of husbands, partners or parents of girls . The right of women to exercise their reproductive choice is implicitly protected as the fundamental right under the Indian Constitution. Indian courts play a crucial role in preventing and addressing the ongoing violation of these women rights. Women always possess particular rights which shouldn’t be denied at any cause. One such right is her right to exercise her reproductive choice. All of us have a right to body autonomy, which means we should be able to make decisions about our bodies on our own. In our society, women and girls are often denied reproductive choices. It is not only immoral and discriminatory, but it also infringes on their basic human rights, including the right to life and dignity. It adds to disparity and violence. The right of reproductive choices is a basic fundamental right that should be granted to all without question and with dignity. With the passage of time, tremendous progress in implementing reproductive health has been made. There is still a long way to go in fully acknowledging reproductive rights. The ultimate purpose of the right to reproduction is the individual's well-being and thus everyone should be able to freely exercise their reproductive choice. Not only will better approach to reproductive health assist women, but it will also benefit society as a whole. Men, particularly spouses, must come out in support, accept their wives consent, and participate equally in the decision-making process. The government must ensure proper reproductive health as well as reproductive information and education to safeguard the individual’s rights and promote wellbeing and a healthy lifestyle.

Colonization and reproduction of the Pied Water-Tyrant (Fluvicola pica, Tyrannidae) in intervened open spaces on the island of Margarita, Nueva Esparta state, Venezuela.
 
Abstract. Here we report the establishment and reproduction of the Pied Water-Tyrant in intervened spaces in the territory of Margarita island (Caribbean sea, northeastern Venezuela). Visualizations were obtained from a non-systematic monitoring of birds started in 2014, in the sector nominated “El Puertico-Hato La Teja”, within the boundaries of the Laguna de Las Marites Natural Monument (LLM-NM). From January 2017 to August 2021, monthly censuses were carried out in five locations of the LLM-NM. Occasional observations were also incorporated, from 2016 to June 2021, in five locations on the island of Margarita, complemented with records in the eBird online database. All the locations of observation and records consulted were related to aquatic environments fed or nourished by the discharges (intentional or accidental leaks) of sewage from the sewage network of the urban planning and from the treatment systems of the plants established in the entity insular, whose frequent flooding in terrestrial spaces and water courses, favored the development of a vegetation made up of mangroves, and patches of freshwater plant species such as Typha dominguensis and Juncus sp., which favored the presence and reproduction of the species in these new habitats.",2021-12-16,Zenodo,5791742,https://zenodo.org/records/5791742

DLAGNOSIS AND RELATIONSHIPS  X. karachiense n. sp. belongs to the group 5 of Loof and Luc (1990) by having two complete genital branches with same length or nearly so and the presence of pseudo-Z-organ in the uterus. X. karachiense n. sp. can be separated from ail the species of genus Xiphinema by a combination of following characters: body and odontostyle length, c' value, sexual dimorphism in tail: convex conoid with broadly rounded terminus in female and digitate in males.  The new species closely resembles X. imùalOr Heyns, 1965 and X. melilense Lamberti el al., 1982 and is also quite similar to X. majus Bos & Loof, 1984 by its more posterior vulva, in the presence of males and in the heat relaxed body posture, but it can be distinguished from X. imitalOr in the length of the body (2.6-3.2 vs 1.9-2.6 mm), odontostyle length (113-123!lm vs 74- 101!lm), greater c' value (1.0-1.4 vs 0.8- 1.0), tail convex conoid with broadly rounded terminus against terminus either bluntly rounded or with a small digitate non protoplasmic process, smaller number of inclusions in the pseudo-Z-organ in contrast to large number of inclusions and also the absence of sexual dimorphism in tail vs sexual dimorphism in tail in X. karachiense n. sp.  It differs from X. melitense by much smaller size, shorter spear, greater c' value, head with slight depression and pseudo-Z-organ without spines (in X. melilense: L = 4.0- 4.9 mm; odontostyle = 132- 168!lm; odontophore = 81 - 100; c' = 0.7-0.9) lip region rounded, offset from the body by a slight depression and moreover presence of spiniform structures (spines) and pseudo-Z-organ in the uterus.  It can further be distinguished from X. majus by its shorter body, smaller odontostyle and odontophore, greater c' value and in the general shape of the tail.  According to the polytomous key given by Loof & Luc (1990) X. karachiense n. sp. has the following code numbers: A4, B2, C6, D5, E5/6, F3, G2, H2, 13/4, J6, K2, L2.",1992-01-01,Zenodo,8122523,https://zenodo.org/records/8122523

Metasomal tergite II with lateral depression composed of tubercle with wide fovea, thick and conspicuous bristles on the border of each depression. Posterior hypopygeal margin straight. Genitalia: paramere with straight apex, wide, as long as basiparamere; aedeagal ventral ramus as long as dorsal body, apex pointed, laminar, divergent, narrow; aedeagal dorsal body with two pair of apical lobes, outer lobe leaf-shaped, median folded region, dorsal pair narrow, apex rounded, slightly arched outward; basal process absent; apodeme extending beyond genital ring. Female unknown.  Variations. Apical lobes of aedeagal dorsal body very short, short or wide.  Remarks. This species belongs to the setosus species-group by having the tergal process with lateral depression with one pair of tubercles, and the lateral margin setose. This species is not similar to other species of its species-group. It is different mainly because has the mandible with four apical teeth and the paramere not arched, the aedeagal ventral ramus with the apex pointed, and the aedeagal dorsum with the outer lobe leaf-shaped.

10.5281/zenodo.7957165,Teaching Norms to Large Language Models - The Next Frontier of Hybrid Governance,https://zenodo.org/api/records/7957165,Wolfgang Schulz; Christian Ollig,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing capabilities, enabling them to generate human-like text. However, their growing presence raises concerns about potential societal risks and ethical considerations. To ensure responsible deployment of LLMs, it is crucial to teach them societal norms. This blog post explores the ways in which we can teach norms to LLMs and introduces the concept of hybrid governance, which emphasizes the interdependencies of public and private norms. We will also delve into DeepMind Sparrow and its 23 rules for reinforced human feedback as an example to illustrate effective norm teaching methods.",2023-05-23,Zenodo,7957165,https://zenodo.org/records/7957165
