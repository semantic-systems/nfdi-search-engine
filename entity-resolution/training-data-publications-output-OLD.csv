It enables researchers to share their materials via dedicated workflows, services and infrastructures and ultimately is intended to ensure that data – and in particular datasets underlying published results — are well documented, curated, persistent, interoperable, reusable, citable, attributable, quality assured and discoverable. Needless to say, data publishing workflows potentially have an enormous impact on researchers, research practices and publishing paradigms, as well as on funding strategies, and career and research evaluations.
            It is crucial for all stakeholders to understand the options for data publishing workflows and to be aware of emerging standards and best practices. To that end, the RDA-WDS Data Publishing Workflows group set out to survey the current data publishing workflow landscape across disciplines while at the same time paying attention to discipline-specific characteristics. We looked at a diverse set of workflows, including basic self-publishing services, institutional data repositories, curated data repositories, and joint data journal and repository arrangements to identify common components and standard practices. This permitted us to identify, analyze and categorize the main building blocks comprising data publishing workflows. We wanted to understand how workflows differ based on the desired outputs and how community needs play a role in workflows. Interestingly, we found that core concepts are congruent across disciplines and data publishing workflows.
            The present paper describes our findings and presents them as components of a data publishing reference model. Based on the assessment of the current data publishing landscape, we highlight important gaps and challenges to consider, especially when dealing with more complex workflows and their integration into the wider community frameworks. We conclude the paper with recommendations to advance data publishing in line with the identified standards. It is our hope that as more research communities seek to publish data associated with their research, they will build on one or more of the components identified in creating their own workflows and thus accelerate uptake.",Eudat,2016-07-03

16,1.0,Template-based Question Answering using Recursive Neural Networks,Ram G Athreya; Srividya K. Bansal; Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo; Ricardo Usbeck,"Most question answering (QA) systems over Linked Data, i.e. Knowledge Graphs, approach the question answering task as a conversion from a natural language question to its corresponding SPARQL query. A common approach is to use query templates to generate SPARQL queries with slots that need to be filled. Using templates instead of running an extensive NLP pipeline or end-to-end model shifts the QA problem into a classification task, where the system needs to match the input question to the appropriate template. This paper presents an approach to automatically learn and classify natural language questions into corresponding templates using recursive neural networks. Our model was trained on 5000 questions and their respective SPARQL queries from the preexisting LC-QuAD dataset grounded in DBpedia, spanning 5042 entities and 615 predicates. The resulting model was evaluated using the FAIR GERBIL QA framework resulting in 0.419 macro f-measure on LC-QuAD and 0.417 macro f-measure on QALD-7.",IEEE,27-29 Jan. 2021
2,0.90729284,Tree-KGQA: An Unsupervised Approach for Question Answering Over Knowledge Graphs,Md Rashad Al Hasan Rony; Debanjan Chaudhuri; Ricardo Usbeck; Jens Lehmann,"Most Knowledge Graph-based Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on training data to reach their optimal performance. However, acquiring training data for supervised systems is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address this, in this paper, we propose Tree-KGQA, an unsupervised KGQA system leveraging pre-trained language models and tree-based algorithms. Entity and relation linking are essential components of any KGQA system. We employ several pre-trained language models in the entity linking task to recognize the entities mentioned in the question and obtain the contextual representation for indexing. Furthermore, for relation linking we incorporate a pre-trained language model previously trained for language inference task. Finally, we introduce a novel algorithm for extracting the answer entities from a KG, where we construct a forest of interpretations and introduce tree-walking and tree disambiguation techniques. Our algorithm uses the linked relation and predicts the tree branches that eventually lead to the potential answer entities. The proposed method achieves 4.5% and 7.1% gains in F1 score in entity linking tasks on LC-QuAD 2.0 and LC-QuAD 2.0 (KBpearl) datasets, respectively, and a 5.4% increase in the relation linking task on LC-QuAD 2.0 (KBpearl). The comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our unsupervised KGQA approach outperforms other supervised state-of-the-art methods on the WebQSP-WD test set (1.4% increase in F1 score) - without training on the target dataset.",IEEE,2022
17,1.0,QALD-9-plus: A Multilingual Dataset for Question Answering over DBpedia and Wikidata Translated by Native Speakers,Aleksandr Perevalov; Dennis Diefenbach; Ricardo Usbeck; Andreas Both,"The ability to have the same experience for different user groups (i.e., accessibility) is one of the most important characteristics of Web-based systems. The same is true for Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems that provide the access to Semantic Web data via natural language interface. While following our research agenda on the multilingual aspect of accessibility of KGQA systems, we identified several ongoing challenges. One of them is the lack of multilingual KGQA benchmarks. In this work, we extend one of the most popular KGQA benchmarks - QALD-9 by introducing high-quality questions' translations to 8 languages provided by native speakers, and transferring the SPARQL queries of QALD-9 from DBpedia to Wikidata, s.t., the usability and relevance of the dataset is strongly increased. Five of the languages - Armenian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Bashkir and Belarusian - to our best knowledge were never considered in KGQA research community before. The latter two of the languages are considered as “endangered” by UNESCO. We call the extended dataset QALD-9-plus and made it available online11Figshare: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.16864273. GitHub: https://github.com/Perevalov/qald_9_plus.",IEEE,26-28 Jan. 2022
18,1.0,Holistic and scalable ranking of RDF data,Axel-Cyrille; Ngonga Ngomo; Michael Hoffmann; Ricardo Usbeck; Kunal Jha,"The volume and number of data sources published using Semantic Web standards such as RDF grows continuously. The largest of these data sources now contain billions of facts and are updated periodically. A large number of applications driven by such data sources requires the ranking of entities and facts contained in such knowledge graphs. Hence, there is a need for time-efficient approaches that can compute ranks for entities and facts simultaneously. In this paper, we present the first holistic ranking approach for RDF data. Our approach, dubbed HARE, allows the simultaneous computation of ranks for RDF triples, resources, properties and literals. To this end, HARE relies on the representation of RDF graphs as bi-partite graphs. It then employs a time-efficient extension of the random walk paradigm to bi-partite graphs. We show that by virtue of this extension, the worst-case complexity of HARE is O(n5) while that of PageRank is O(n6). In addition, we evaluate the practical efficiency of our approach by comparing it with PageRank on 6 real and 6 synthetic datasets with sizes up to 108 triples. Our results show that HARE is up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than PageRank. We also present a brief evaluation of HARE's ranking accuracy by comparing it with that of PageRank applied directly to RDF graphs. Our evaluation on 19 classes of DBpedia demonstrates that there is no statistical difference between HARE and PageRank. We hence conclude that our approach goes beyond the state of the art by allowing the ranking of all RDF entities and of RDF triples without being worse w.r.t. the ranking quality it achieves on resources. HARE is open-source and is available at http://github.com/dice-group/hare.",IEEE,11-14 Dec. 2017
