In this article, a nonintrusive computational strategy for iterative solution to the nonlinear behavior in the subdomains is proposed. To estimate the residual force on the interface connecting the subdomains with nonmatching discretizations, variational principles with an intermediate framework are proposed to assure satisfaction of virtual work principle in the subdomains and to assure displacement/traction compatibility at the interface. To map nodal force from one subdomain to the other, both global Lagrange multiplier (GLM) and local Lagrange multiplier (LLM) methods are discussed. Quasi-Newton iterative updates are used to correct displacements on the interface connecting the different subdomains until equilibrium is reached. A symmetric rank 1 update as well as the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) update are considered for accelerating the solution convergence. The developed method is suitable for the modular construction of submodels with nonmatching discretizations and even allows coupling between subdomains analyzed using different (commercial or custom) codes. The iterative global–local coupling strategy is validated on several examples, including an L-shaped domain with local nonlinearity and a rectangular plate with a propagating crack. Another example illustrating the coupling of domains independently analyzed using commercial finite element codes ANSYS and ABAQUS is next demonstrated. Finally, the method is demonstrated to analyze semiconductor chip assemblies where plastic ratcheting of the interconnect line causes passivation coating fracture.",14-04-22,IEEE,9757156,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9757156/

Previous methods ignore a significant specificity of the task: the difficulty of RSICC is different for unchanged and changed image pairs. They process the unchanged and changed image pairs in a coupled way, which usually causes confusion for change captioning. In this article, we decouple the task into two issues to ease it: whether and what changes have occurred. An image-level classifier performs binary classification to address the first issue. A feature-level encoder contributes to extracting discriminative features to help the caption generation module address the second issue. Besides, for caption generation, we utilize prompt learning to introduce pretrained large language models (LLMs) into the RSICC task. A multiprompt learning strategy is proposed to generate a set of unified prompts and a class-specific prompt conditioned on the image-level classifier’s results. The strategy can prompt a pretrained LLM to know whether changes exist and generate captions. Finally, the multiple prompts and the visual features of the feature-level encoder are fed into a frozen LLM for language generation. Compared with previous methods, our method can leverage the powerful abilities of the pretrained LLM in language to generate plausible captions, which is free of training. Extensive experiments show that our method is effective and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Besides, an additional experiment demonstrates that our decoupling paradigm is more promising than the previous coupled paradigm for the RSICC task.

Although the initial thermal decomposition mechanism of LLM-105 has been studied based on quantum chemical calculations, the internal mechanism of the two-step thermal decomposition still lacks experimental research. Thus, this study involves a detailed experimental study to reveal the mechanism of the two-step thermal decomposition of LLM-105. The results showed that LLM-105 decay was a consecutive reaction. The first-step reaction dominated the early stage of the LLM-105 decomposition, and its products participated in the reaction of the second step. The cleavage of NO2 and NH2 groups of LLM-105 mainly occurred in the first step, while gaseous products NO and C2N2 were released during the second reaction step. The first-step reaction had a higher oxygen consumption rate and a lower carbon consumption rate, producing more heat due to more extensive oxidation of the carbon backbone. The difference in the oxidative ability and reaction rate between the two steps resulted in a two-step exothermic and mass loss behavior.

A comparison of the results obtained by using a traditional production costing method, the OPCOST method with explicit consideration of unit duty cycle effects, and the new method using the LLM model for base-loaded units, called the PROCOP method, shows significant differences in the energies produced by the base-loaded units and consequently the other units. The linkage of a base-loaded unit's need for operation to the load cycle avoids the assumption of the traditional model that the base-loaded units are equally needed all times. It also avoids the ad hoc treatment of outage postponability of base-loaded units.

Dirty lines in write-back data caches are more critical, since the dirty lines have no backups in lower-level memory (LLM). This paper provides a write-buffer scheme for backing up dirty lines to protect cache memories based on the replication mechanism combined with interleaving parity check against multiple-bit errors. The write-buffer contains two same replication caches to replicate the dirty data from the original cache, and the two replication caches take turns to write the replicated data back to LLM during the free time when there is no access in LLM. In this way, the dirty data in original cache is backed up to LLM that can be used for error recovery, and meanwhile, spaces of the replication caches are released to replicate new dirty data; moreover, the writebacks of the replicated data can be performed in the background without extra clocks. Simulation results show that the proposed write-buffer scheme can provide a full protection for caches without degrading system performance, while it can improve the system performance by an average of 1.4% due to the background writebacks, and compared with state-of-the-art replication-based technique, it can increase the replication capability by 11.6% and save 6.2% energy consumption in case of the optimal configuration.

However, this method leads to failure of ZVS in the light load condition. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved control scheme with two modes for single-phase ARSI to achieve ZVS from zero load to full load. In heavy load mode (HLM), half of main switches are turned on at ZVS condition by using the output current to reduce the conduction loss. In light load mode (LLM), all the main switches achieve ZVS with the conduction of resonant branch to solve the problem of the failure of ZVS near zero load current. Besides, the auxiliary switches can operate at zero-current-switching (ZCS) condition. The proposed control scheme was first verified in the simulation and then validated in the experiment with an inverter prototype. The results show that the proposed control scheme can make main switches achieve ZVS from zero load to full load.",14-07-16,IEEE,7512469,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7512469/

With its promising classification performance, DBN-TSK-FC features sharing both the powerful neural representation ability of a DBN and the strong uncertainty-handling capability of an interpretable fuzzy representation. On the one hand, DBN-TSK-FC builds its interpretable fuzzy representation in a hierarchical way by applying the classical fuzzy clustering algorithm FCM to obtain fuzzy partitions on the training dataset. Then, it forms interpretable antecedent parts of fuzzy rules as the corresponding fuzzy representation. On the other hand, DBN-TSK-FC builds its DBN-based neural representation in the other hierarchical way. That is, it applies the existing unsupervised DBN pretraining on the training dataset and then takes the neural representation of all the hidden nodes in the top layer of the corresponding DBN as the set of consequent variables of fuzzy rules. In this approach, both the interpretable fuzzy representation and the DBN-based neural representation are further fused to form the corresponding fuzzy rules quickly by using the least learning machine (LLM) on both the fuzzy rules and the labeling information of the original dataset. Therefore, DBN-TSK-FC is essentially a deep TSK fuzzy classifier from the perspective of fuzzy rules, and it indeed avoids the very slow fine-tuning training required after the unsupervised pretraining of the existing DBN learning. The experimental results on the MovementAAL_RSS dataset indicate the effectiveness of the proposed classifier DBN-TSK-FC.",22-04-19,IEEE,8695137,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8695137/

Intent-based infrastructure management is a means to simplify management by allowing users to specify intents, i.e., high-level statements in natural language, that are automatically realized by the system. However, providing intent-based multi-domain infrastructure management poses a number of challenges: 1) intent translation; 2) plan execution and parallelization; 3) incompatible cross-domain abstractions. To tackle these challenges, we propose AppleSeed, an intent-based infrastructure management system that enables an end-to-end intent-to-deployment pipeline. AppleSeed uses few-shot learning for training a Large Language Model (LLM) to translate intents into intermediate programs, which are processed by a just-in-time compiler and a materialization module to automatically generate parallelizable, domain-specific executable programs. We evaluate the system in two use cases: Deep Packet Inspection (DPI); and machine learning training and inferencing. Our system achieves efficient intent translation into an execution plan with an average 22.3x lines of code to intent word ratio.

The oracle problem is a major challenge in testing such systems, where it is difficult to determine whether or not the output of a system is correct. Metamorphic testing (MT) can alleviate this problem by checking the consistency of the system’s outputs under various transformations. However, manual generation of MRs is often a time-consuming and error-prone process. Automated MR generation can yield several benefits, including enhanced efficiency, quality, coverage, scalability, and reusability in software testing, thereby facilitating a more comprehensive and effective testing process. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT for automatic generation of MRs for ADSs. We provide a detailed methodology for generating MRs using ChatGPT and evaluate the generated MRs using our domain knowledge and existing MRs. The results of our study indicate that our proposed approach is effective at generating high-quality MRs, and can significantly reduce the manual effort required for MR generation.

However, current state-of-the-art traditional and learning-based APR techniques face the problem of limited patch variety, failing to fix complicated bugs. This is mainly due to the reliance on bug-fixing datasets to craft fix templates (traditional) or directly predict potential patches (learning-based). Large Pre-Trained Language Models (LLMs), trained using billions of text/code tokens, can potentially help avoid this issue. Very recently, researchers have directly leveraged LLMs for APR without relying on any bug-fixing datasets. Meanwhile, such existing work either failed to include state-of-the-art LLMs or was not evaluated on realistic datasets. Thus, the true power of modern LLMs on the important APR problem is yet to be revealed. In this work, we perform the first extensive study on directly applying LLMs for APR. We select 9 recent state-of-the-art LLMs, including both generative and infilling models, ranging from 125M to 20B in size. We designed 3 different repair settings to evaluate the different ways we can use LLMs to generate patches: 1) generate the entire patch function, 2) fill in a chunk of code given the prefix and suffix 3) output a single line fix. We apply the LLMs under these repair settings on 5 datasets across 3 different languages and compare different LLMs in the number of bugs fixed, generation speed and compilation rate. We also compare the LLMs against recent state-of-the-art APR tools. Our study demonstrates that directly applying state-of-the-art LLMs can already substantially outperform all existing APR techniques on all our datasets. Among the studied LLMs, the scaling effect exists for APR where larger models tend to achieve better performance. Also, we show for the first time that suffix code after the buggy line (adopted in infilling-style APR) is important in not only generating more fixes but more patches with higher compilation rate. Besides patch generation, the LLMs consider correct patches to be more natural than other ones, and can even be leveraged for effective patch ranking or patch correctness checking. Lastly, we show that LLM-based APR can be further substantially boosted via: 1) increasing the sample size, and 2) incorporating fix template information.",14-07-23,IEEE,10172803,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10172803/
